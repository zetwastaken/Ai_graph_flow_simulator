"""Placeholder for anomaly injection logic.

In the current MVP the injection of anomalies (leaks, meter offsets, etc.)
is handled directly within :mod:`project.sim.generator`.  This module
exists as a stub for future refactoring when the event handling grows
complex enough to warrant its own namespace.  At that point the
``inject_events`` function can be relocated here and extended with
additional anomaly types and sophisticated behaviours.
